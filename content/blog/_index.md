# Teaching Units

This section contains comprehensive teaching units in blog-style format. Each unit is presented as a single page with a table of contents on the right side, allowing students to see the entire unit at once while easily navigating to specific sections.

## Available Units

* **Unit 1** - Introduction to the subject with foundational concepts
* **Unit 2** - Building on the basics with more advanced topics

## How to Use Teaching Units

Each teaching unit is designed to be a complete lesson that can be:

1. Followed sequentially from beginning to end
2. Used as a reference with the help of the table of contents
3. Printed or saved as PDF for offline use

## Creating New Units

When creating new teaching units, follow these guidelines:

* Use clear headings and subheadings to organize content
* Include a mix of text, images, and other media
* Add practical examples and exercises
* Consider different learning styles in your presentation
