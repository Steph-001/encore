# Audio Embedding

This page demonstrates how to embed audio files in your teaching materials. Audio files are essential for language teaching, allowing students to hear correct pronunciation and practice listening skills.

## Example Audio

Below is an example of an embedded audio player:

{{< audio src="https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" >}}

## How to Use the Audio Shortcode

To embed an audio file in your content, use the following shortcode:

```
{{</* audio src="path/to/your/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" */>}}
```

Replace the path with the URL or local path to your audio file. The `type` parameter is optional but recommended for better browser compatibility.

## Benefits of Using Audio in Language Teaching

Audio resources are particularly valuable in language teaching:

1. Demonstrates correct pronunciation and intonation
2. Develops listening comprehension skills
3. Exposes students to different accents and speaking styles
4. Provides authentic language examples
5. Supports auditory learners

Consider including audio recordings of vocabulary words, dialogues, and listening comprehension exercises. You can also create audio versions of reading passages to help students connect written and spoken forms of the language.
