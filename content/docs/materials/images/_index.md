# Image Galleries

This page demonstrates how to create image galleries in your teaching materials. Image galleries are useful for displaying multiple related images in an organized and visually appealing way.

## Example Gallery

Below is an example of an image gallery:

{{< gallery images="https://placehold.co/600x400/png?text=English+Grammar+Chart,https://placehold.co/600x400/png?text=Vocabulary+Diagram,https://placehold.co/600x400/png?text=Pronunciation+Guide" >}}

## How to Use the Gallery Shortcode

To create an image gallery in your content, use the following shortcode:

```
{{</* gallery images="path/to/image1.jpg,path/to/image2.jpg,path/to/image3.jpg" */>}}
```

You can include as many images as you want, separated by commas. The gallery will automatically arrange them in a responsive grid.

## Best Practices for Using Images in Teaching

When using images in your teaching materials, consider the following best practices:

1. Use high-quality, clear images that are relevant to the content
2. Include alternative text for accessibility
3. Ensure proper attribution for any images you don't own
4. Optimize image sizes for faster loading
5. Use consistent dimensions for a more polished look

Images can be particularly helpful for visual learners and can make complex concepts more accessible. Consider using diagrams, charts, and infographics to supplement your text-based content.
