# PDF Embedding

This page demonstrates how to embed PDF documents in your teaching materials. Embedded PDFs allow students to view documents directly within the page without downloading them.

## Example PDF

Below is an example of an embedded PDF document:

{{< pdf src="/pdf/test.pdf" >}}

## How to Use the PDF Shortcode

To embed a PDF in your content, use the following shortcode:

```
{{</* pdf src="path/to/your/document.pdf" */>}}
```

Replace the path with the URL or local path to your PDF file.

## Benefits of Embedding PDFs

Embedding PDFs in your teaching materials offers several advantages:

1. Students can view documents without leaving the page
2. Provides a consistent reading experience
3. Allows for sharing of worksheets, handouts, and reference materials
4. Preserves formatting of complex documents
5. Makes academic papers and articles easily accessible

Consider embedding PDFs for supplementary reading materials, worksheets, or reference guides that students may need to consult frequently.
