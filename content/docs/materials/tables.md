# Tables in Teaching Materials

Tables are an excellent way to organize and present structured information. This page demonstrates how to create and format tables for your teaching materials.

## Basic Table Structure

Here's a simple table showing the days of the week in different languages:

| English | French  | Spanish  | German   |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Monday  | Lundi   | Lunes    | Montag   |
| Tuesday | Mardi   | Martes   | Dienstag |
| Wednesday | Mercredi | Miércoles | Mittwoch |
| Thursday | Jeudi   | Jueves   | Donnerstag |
| Friday  | Vendredi | Viernes  | Freitag  |
| Saturday | Samedi  | Sábado   | Samstag  |
| Sunday  | Dimanche | Domingo  | Sonntag  |

## Comparison Table

Tables are useful for comparing different items or concepts:

| Feature | Prose | Poetry | Drama |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Structure | Paragraphs | Stanzas | Scenes/Acts |
| Line breaks | Natural | Intentional | Dialogue-based |
| Primary purpose | Narrative | Expression | Performance |
| Typical length | Variable | Concise | Medium to long |
| Voice | Narrator | Speaker | Characters |

## Data Table

Tables can present numerical data effectively:

| Year | English Students | Math Students | Science Students |
|------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 2020 | 120 | 105 | 98 |
| 2021 | 125 | 110 | 102 |
| 2022 | 118 | 115 | 105 |
| 2023 | 130 | 120 | 110 |
| 2024 | 135 | 125 | 115 |

## Creating Tables in Markdown

Tables in Markdown are created using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`). Here's the syntax for a simple table:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
```

### Table Formatting Tips

1. **Alignment**: You can align text in columns by using colons in the header row:
   - Left-aligned: `:---`
   - Right-aligned: `---:`
   - Center-aligned: `:---:`

2. **Width**: Table columns automatically adjust to content, but you can use spaces to create wider columns.

3. **Complex Content**: You can include links, emphasis, and other formatting within table cells.

## HTML Tables for More Complex Needs

For more complex tables, you can use HTML:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>Grammar Point</th>
      <th>Example</th>
      <th>Usage Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Present Simple</td>
      <td>I <strong>speak</strong> English.</td>
      <td>Used for habits, general truths, and scheduled events</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Present Continuous</td>
      <td>I <strong>am speaking</strong> English now.</td>
      <td>Used for actions happening now or temporary situations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Present Perfect</td>
      <td>I <strong>have spoken</strong> English for 10 years.</td>
      <td>Used for actions that started in the past and continue to the present</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Responsive Tables

For mobile-friendly tables that work well on small screens, you can add the `table-responsive` class:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Literary Period</th>
        <th>Approximate Dates</th>
        <th>Key Characteristics</th>
        <th>Notable Authors</th>
        <th>Representative Works</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Renaissance</td>
        <td>14th-17th century</td>
        <td>Humanism, classical influences, individualism</td>
        <td>Shakespeare, Marlowe, Spenser</td>
        <td>Hamlet, Doctor Faustus, The Faerie Queene</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Romanticism</td>
        <td>Late 18th-mid 19th century</td>
        <td>Emotion, nature, individualism, imagination</td>
        <td>Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats</td>
        <td>Lyrical Ballads, Kubla Khan, Ode to a Nightingale</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Modernism</td>
        <td>Early-mid 20th century</td>
        <td>Experimentation, fragmentation, stream of consciousness</td>
        <td>Joyce, Woolf, Eliot</td>
        <td>Ulysses, Mrs. Dalloway, The Waste Land</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
