# Video Embedding

This page demonstrates how to embed videos in your teaching materials. Videos are a powerful tool for visual learning and can help students understand complex concepts.

## Example Video

Below is an example of an embedded YouTube video about language learning:

{{< video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_EQDtpYSNM" >}}

## How to Use the Video Shortcode

To embed a video in your content, use the following shortcode:

```
{{</* video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" */>}}
```

Replace `VIDEO_ID` with the ID of your YouTube video. You can also use other video platforms that provide embed URLs.

## Benefits of Using Videos in Teaching

Videos can enhance your teaching in several ways:

1. Visual demonstration of concepts
2. Engaging content that maintains student interest
3. Ability to pause, rewind, and review material at the student's pace
4. Access to expert explanations and demonstrations
5. Cultural context for language learning

Consider incorporating videos that show real-world applications of the concepts you're teaching, or that provide cultural context for language learning.
